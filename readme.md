There are three levels of work:
sequence,element and settings/global/current

For the sequence it is important at all times to keep a perspective of where we are standing.
Therefor we want a clean tree view where:
* Each object takes at most one line
* Each element should have a derived name (name/alias > stem > inherit > type)
* Should always be visible

From the sequence view it should be possible to 
* navigate between elements
* add new mixer/element
* re-order to a certain extent

The element view:
* should focus on a single element
* break down the options so that users won't be flooded by options
* minimal navigation across parts of the element
* export to set / import to sequence
